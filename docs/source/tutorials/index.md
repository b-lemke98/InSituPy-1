# Tutorials

Notebooks demonstrating the use of `InSituPy` for analyzing single-cell spatial transcriptomics data.

The tutorial is structured in three main topics:

```{eval-rst}
.. card:: Preprocessing of samples
    :link: preprocessing/index
    :link-type: doc
    :link-alt: Preprocessing Tutorial

    Tutorials focusing on preprocessing steps that are necessary before actually getting started with the analysis.


.. card:: Aanalysis of individual samples
    :link: sample_level/index
    :link-type: doc
    :link-alt: Tutorial on analysis of individual samples

    Tutorials about data loading and analysis of individual samples using the `InSituData` class.

.. card:: Multi-sample analysis
    :link: multisample_level/index
    :link-type: doc
    :link-alt: Multi-sample analysis tutorial

    This set of tutorials focuses on the analysis of multiple samples using the `InSituExperiment` class.
