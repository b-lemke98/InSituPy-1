# Step-by-step analysis

This section provides a detailed, step-by-step demonstration of the preprocessing, analysis, and handling of individual samples in single-cell spatial transcriptomics data using **InSituPy**. Each part of the tutorial builds upon the previous one, and it is recommended to follow the steps sequentially from top to bottom to ensure proper functionality.
